    "5. Apply correction 1: Insert \"the\" before \"best solution\". The phrase becomes \"the best solution\".\n",
    "6. Identify potential error/improvement area 2: The phrase \"for the problems\". While grammatically plausible, using \"the\" implies specific, previously identified problems. The context seems general. Improving grammatical flow or clarity might involve adjusting this.\n",
    "7. Consider alternatives for \"the problems\": \"for problems\" (too general?), \"for specific problems\" (adds info), \"for different problems\" (suggests variety, often fits general statements well).\n",
    "8. Apply correction 2: Replace \"the problems\" with \"different problems\" for better contextual fit and naturalness, aligning with the goal of general grammatical improvement and clarity often included in \"Fix grammar\" tasks.\n",
