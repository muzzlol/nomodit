    "2.  Analyze the original text segment that follows the instruction in `src`.\n",
    "3.  Apply the instruction step-by-step to the original text.\n",
    "4.  For each step or change you make, articulate the precise reasoning based on linguistic rules, the instruction's goal (e.g., grammar, clarity, simplification), or common writing conventions. Explain *why* a change is necessary or beneficial according to the instruction.\n",
    "5.  Your reasoning should demonstrate *how* to arrive at the corrected text, simulating the thought process of performing the edit yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially:** Your reasoning process should *not* refer to or imply knowledge of a pre-existing target or corrected text. Focus *only* on applying the instruction to the source text to derive the necessary changes.\n",

    "3. Focus on the second clause: \"they cannot find best solution for the problems.\"\n",
    "4. Identify potential error 1: The noun phrase \"best solution\". \"Best\" is a superlative adjective. Grammatical rule: Superlative adjectives modifying singular countable nouns generally require a definite article (\"the\").\n",
    "5. Apply correction 1: Insert \"the\" before \"best solution\". The phrase becomes \"the best solution\".\n",
    "6. Identify potential error/improvement area 2: The phrase \"for the problems\". While grammatically plausible, using \"the\" implies specific, previously identified problems. The context seems general. Improving grammatical flow or clarity might involve adjusting this.\n",
    "7. Consider alternatives for \"the problems\": \"for problems\" (too general?), \"for specific problems\" (adds info), \"for different problems\" (suggests variety, often fits general statements well).\n",
    "8. Apply correction 2: Replace \"the problems\" with \"different problems\" for better contextual fit and naturalness, aligning with the goal of general grammatical improvement and clarity often included in \"Fix grammar\" tasks.\n",
    "9. Synthesized correction based on reasoning: The corrected clause is \"they cannot find the best solution for different problems.\" The full sentence derived from applying the grammar fixes is \"If engineers do not come up with new ideas, they cannot find the best solution for different problems.\"\n",
